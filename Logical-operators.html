                    ==> In Logical (&&) AND operator both 1st and 2nd must be True
                        in order to get True result or function or a statement will run.
                        If any of two operands are not True meaning the second is false
                        the result will False or a function or a statement won't run.
                     
                    ==> Logical (||) OR operator if both operands are True the result will be
                    True, if 1st operand is True and 2nd operand is false or vice versa 
                    the result will be True. And if both the operands are False the result will
                    be False.
                
                    ==> Logical (!) operator works opposite to the operand value. If the operand
                    value is True the result will be False. If the operand value is false the 
                    result will be True.
